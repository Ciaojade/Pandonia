Pandonia
==========

Pandonia is a set of styles used by Flickr for our OSM map tiles. It's based on
[OSM Bright][] and is written in [Carto][]. It's intended to be used with
[TileMill][], which is awesome.

We are actively developing these styles, and would appreciate any bug 
reports, feature requests, or photos of kittens filed in the [issue tracker][].
